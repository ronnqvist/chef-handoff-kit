Title: Initialise a GitHub repository (MCP)
Goal: Create a new GitHub repo and push the current project when ready.
Steps:
1. Use the GitHub MCP tools with approval:
   - Create a repository `<OWNER>/<REPO>` (private).
   - Initialise a local git repo if needed; stage all files; commit with a message like `"chore: initial import from Chef"`.
   - Add the remote origin and push the main branch.
2. Show the repository URL and next steps.
Output: The new repository URL and a summary of what was done.
